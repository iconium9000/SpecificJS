SpecificJS

Informal NodeJS project for hosting games that I work on while practicing skills.
Not really designed to be readable and is full of spaghetti code as I have honed my skills over the last few years.

Rather than learn the lesson from GeneralJS, I simply remade it. This project has been far more reliable, but still has had issues.
