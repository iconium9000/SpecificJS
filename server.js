    <li>Click and drag to launch balls!</li>
    <li>Designed to display basic ballistic physics.</li>
    <li>There are two collision modes; simple and complex.</li>
    <ul><li>Simple swap of the momenta balls which come into contact with each other.
    This mode allows for some fun experiments and interesting behaviors.</li>
    <li>Complex takes into account the locations of each ball
      in a collision and only swaps the velocities which are
      aligned with the distance vector between the colliding balls.</li></ul>

    <li>Employed a simple, chunk-based system which massively improves
      algorithmic complexity.
      Each ball only checks for collisions with balls in its
      immediate vicinity corresponding to the radius of the
      largest ball on screen.
    <ul><li>This still has O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity in the worst case,
      but that worst case only occurs when many balls occupy the same chunks.</li>
    <li>You can see this chunk system work in action by enabling "Show Chunks",
      but this tends to add a performance penalty.</li></ul>
